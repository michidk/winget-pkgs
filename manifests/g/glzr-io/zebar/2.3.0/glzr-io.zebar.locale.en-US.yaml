ReleaseNotes: |-
  üéâ New features
  - Adjust widget position for monitor DPI (#119).
      - Fixes issues where the widget window was getting positioned/sized incorrectly.
  - Account for window width and height in anchor position (#122).
      - e.g. "anchor": "bottom_left" would previously place the top left corner of the window at the bottom left of the monitor and would then have to be manually offset. Now, it places the bottom-left corner of the window in the bottom-left of the monitor.
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Fix incorrect casing in query monitors CLI command response.
  - Hide scrollbar on overflow in example templates (#120).
  üõ†Ô∏èÔ∏è Internal changes
  - Bump glazewm package to latest.
