  Zebar V2: Production-Ready Release ‚ö°
  With GlazeWM V3 and now, Zebar V2, the theme of the last few months has been big rewrites and breaking changes. This release is a large redesign of Zebar's core functionality based on community feedback.New config files are generated on launch to %userprofile%/.glzr/zebar (no need to make backups of existing config - they won't conflict). This is a breaking change to existing configs.Major changes
  1. New config format
  - YAML config is gone, templating syntax is gone, and inline HTML/CSS in the config file is gone.
  - Instead, point to an HTML file with the markup and styling of your widget. Any frontend framework can be used (React, SolidJS, Angular, Vue, etc.).
  - Zebar now exposes providers via a JS library published as zebar on NPM.
  2. No start script
  - Just launch the Zebar application normally.
  3. Modular config files
  - Each widget now has its own config file. This makes it way easier to share widgets - just zip it up and then unzip it into the %userprofile%/.glzr/zebar folder.
  4. Toggle active widgets
  - Choose which widgets to have active by enabling/disabling them in the system tray menu.
  - To choose which widgets should be opened when Zebar starts up, check the "Launch on startup" option.
